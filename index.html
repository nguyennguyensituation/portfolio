        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <h2 id="title-sentence">
          I'm a <span class="strikethrough">Mascot Designer,</span> <span class="strikethrough">Illustrator,</span> <span class="strikethrough">Author,</span> <span class="strikethrough">UX Writer,</span> <span class="strikethrough">Product Manager,</span>
          <br>Software Developer.
        </h2>

        <p>I chose the classic freelance mascot designer to software engineer career path, with a series of creative and tech jobs along the way. I've spent the last decade working in nearly every part of the tech ecosystem, from product strategy, design, and content creation; to building and supporting software.</p>

        <p>The common thread among all these roles is that they gave me the opportunity to do the two things I love most:
          <span class="tooltip" id="asterisk">solve problems
            <span class="tooltiptext" id="problems-tooltip">
            <b>A Few of My Favorite Problems</b><br><br>
            1. <b>I once had to perform emergency mascot surgery</b> to ensure that a certain beer mascot would be ready in time for the Super Bowl.<br><br>
            2. Frustrated with how confusing and inefficient my new hire training was, I learned how to code and <b>I built a learning app to replace the old training program</b>. It was eventually adopted by multiple departments and used by hundreds of employees at my company.
            <br><br>
            3. Tasked with teaching a team of non-devs Git, <b>I developed and led Git trainings based entirely around Post Malone's face tattoos</b>. For months after, you could find little cutouts of Post Malone's face scattered in every corner of the office.
          </span>
        </span> and build beautiful things out of nothing. I doesn't matter if I'm solving problems for a Fortune 500 company, a teammate, or an end user in Indiana&mdash;I always bring creativity, technical expertise, and good humor to every new project.</p>
